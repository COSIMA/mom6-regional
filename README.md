# A Modular Modular Ocean Model 6 regional domain generator

*Note: I'm starting this readme again from scratch since the old one is no longer very useful*
*New users should just go through the demo for now to get the hang of things. Better readme coming I promise*

The regional_library.py file contains functions and classes that do most of the legwork in setting up a regional domain in MOM6. Just give it some information about where, when and how big, and point it in the direction of your raw input files, and it'll sort out the boring details to create MOM6 friendly inputs.

There's still some legacy stuff in this repo for now while we get the last of the functionality into the pipeline.

Check out the demo notebook!
